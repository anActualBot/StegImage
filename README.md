**Welcome to StegMaker**


Launch the program by running the "run.py" file


**INTRO**

- This is a python program that hides text and images into other images, creating a new image file that can be decoded
  and the hidden data retrieved at a later time or  by a different user.

- It uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to hide the data.

- The program only works for these file formats: (*.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg).

- All newly created images are saved in a PNG format.


**INCLUDED FILES**

- *run.py* : this is the file that runs the entire program (the "__main__" function)

- *gui_main.py* : includes all gui elements and the main function, this is the core code.

- *utils.py* : this includes some utility functions in addition to the Encoding and Decoding functions.
